# Flutter QR Scanner and Generator
What I learned from this project:
1. Built-in widgets like Scaffold, Column, SingleChildScrollView, ElevatedButton, etc
1. How to create a Stateful Widget
1. How to navigate between pages
1. Asynchronous programming
1. How to generate QR code using `qr_flutter` package
1. How to scan QR code using `barcode_scan2` package
1. How to use `if` in an array
1. Learned how to use `TextEditingController`. It is used to manage the text of a `TextField`. It allows you to retrieve, modify, and listen to the text content programmatically.
